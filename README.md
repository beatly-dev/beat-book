# Introduction

## Beat - State management with a state chart

This project is my toy project to simplify the state management flows in `Flutter`. Whole functionalities are heavily inspired by [`xstate.js`](https://xstate.js.org/docs/). I highly recommend reading the docs of [`xstate.js`](https://xstate.js.org/docs/).&#x20;

Like `xstate.js` provides type-sensitive state management with its typescript implementation, `beat` aims to provide typed state management. `beat` will enable developers to write code quickly without errors thanks to `Dart`'s type system and auto-completion.&#x20;

You can find a detailed introduction to a state chart in the [`xstate.js's introduction section.`](https://xstate.js.org/docs/guides/introduction-to-state-machines-and-statecharts/#states)

## Disclaimer

Although I said `beat` as state management with **a state chart**, `beat` would not strictly follow the state chart XML (SCXML) specifications. And also, `beat` would not strictly follow the `xstate.js`.
